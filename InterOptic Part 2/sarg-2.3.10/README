Installation
------------

1. run ./configure

   Useful configure options:
     --prefix - The root directory of the installation
               default: /usr/local

     --bindir - where sarg binary will be saved
               default: /usr/local/bin

     --sysconfdir - where the configuration directory is
               default: /usr/local/etc

     --mandir - where the sarg man page will be saved
               default: /usr/local/share/man

     --enable-sargphp - where to install sarg-php (--disable-sargphp don't install sarg-php)
               default: /var/www/html

     --enable-fontdir - where to find the fonts for the reports (--diable-fontdir don't install the fonts)
               default: /usr/local/share/sarg/fonts

     --enable-imagedir - where sarg take the images to include in the reports
               default: /usr/local/share/sarg/images

     --enable-extraprotection - compile sarg with extra GCC options for increased security
               default: use standard compilation warnings and no protection
	       If compilation fails, try to configure sarg without this flag.

   For a complete list of all the options, run ./configure --help.

   Example:
     ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc/sarg --enable-extraprotection

3. make

4. sudo make install

5. Go to /usr/local/sarg (or the path defined with --sysconfdir on configure)
   and change sarg.conf to your liking. You may use sarg.conf provided along with
   the sources as a template for your new sarg.conf. In any case, have a look at
   the sample sarg.conf for new options.

6. Install cron jobs to generate the reports.

   For instance, create a file named /etc/cron.daily/sarg with the content:

     #!/bin/sh
     sarg -d day-1 -w /tmp/sarg.daily -o /var/www/squid-reports/Daily /var/log/squid3/access.log*

   A weekly report is produced by /etc/cron.weekly/sarg:

     #!/bin/sh
     sarg -d week-1 -w /tmp/sarg.weekly -o /var/www/squid-reports/Weekly /var/log/squid3/access.log*

   And the monthly report is created with /etc/cron.monthly/sarg:

     #!/bin/sh
     sarg -d month-1 -w /tmp/sarg.monthly -o /var/www/squid-reports/Monthly /var/log/squid3/access.log*

   Make sure all those files are executable:

     chmod 755 /etc/cron.daily/sarg /etc/cron.weekly/sarg /etc/cron.monthly/sarg

Usage: sarg -h

Sorttable.js
------------

Starting with sarg v2.3.2-pre2, a javascript is distributed along with sarg to
dynamically sort the reports. It is sorttable.js written by Stuart Langridge
and available at http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable/.  The version
included with sarg contains some fixes and improvements over the original
version. The patches have been reported to the author but he doesn't seem to
support it any more.

To use sorttable.js (or any other script including your own custom made
script), simply copy it to your website and edit sarg.conf to point the
sorttable option to the location of the script on your website. The path
indicated in sarg.conf must be the path as seen by a client visiting your
server.

Translations
------------

As of March 14th, 2010 (sarg 2.3), the translations have been ported to gettext. This makes it easier
to translate all the messages (the number of translated messages went from 144 to 448). Therefore, the
old language files are obsolete. The old translated message have been converted automatically to
gettext but due to the changes made to the strings in the program after the automatic conversion,
it is likely that the old messages are, at best, meaningless.

Translations are handled at http://translationproject.org/domain/sarg.html. If your language is
not yet supported or the current translation is obsolete, please check with the team working
on your language at the Translation Project to be sure nobody is assigned to sarg. If necessary,
contact the coordinator of that team to join the team and be assigned to sarg.

If no po file exists for you language, download the latest sarg.pot on this page
http://translationproject.org/domain/sarg.html and rename it as YourLanguageCode.po. See
http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#Language-Codes for the list of the
valid languages codes.

Translate YourLanguageCode.po (see http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html for more informations).

Submit the translated po file to robot@translationproject.org. You must be a member of the team
working on the language for which you are submitting the po file or the robot will reject
your file. It is not necessary to fill the disclaimer to translate sarg.
